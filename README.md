# Python_Projects

In Project 1, I gathered questions to test my basic understanding. It includes setting variables, creating lists and simple “For Loops”. 

In Project 2, I imported packages such as Numpy and Pandas and used them to answer questions.

 In Project 3, I added pivot tables, group by and operations with measures of central tendency. 

In project 4, I included visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn. 

In project 5, I analyzed a fitness dataset combining the concepts I learned from my previous projects.
