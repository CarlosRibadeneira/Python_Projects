# Python_Projects

--In project 1 I gathered questions to test my basic understanding. It includes, setting variables, creating lists and simple “For Loops”. In project 2, I imported packages such as Numpy and Pandas and used them to answer questions. In project 3 I added pivot tables, group by and operations with measures of central tendency.  In project 4 I included visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn. Finally, in project 5 y analyze a fitness data combining the concepts I learned.
